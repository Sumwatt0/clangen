# Sumwatt's Realgen

### *"Realgen is the best clangen mod, from the best clangen dev."*
### It makes the cats real, there are basically infinite possible cats because it downloads them from the internet. 


## Requirements
Since Realgen gets random cats from the internet, you will need an internet connection to generate cats.

## Running from Source Code

Realgen requires the use of Poetry for dependencies!

If you have already configured your setup to run from source for Clangen or any other Clangen mod, you do not need any extra steps for Realgen.

Otherwise, follow the instructions on Clangen's github page.

Note that I don't provide support for running from source since builds are available!


## Bug Reporting
Realgen has bugs from clangen development as well as it's own bugs. If you encounter a bug, **DM me on Discord or ping me in the thread.** If you know how to make a **issue on Github**, I would really appreciate if you did that too but make sure to **tell me on Discord!** If you can, I would also appreciate if you checked if the bug is present in Clangen development as well.
